excerpt: "NSWC Corona’s Strategic Plan 2030 details how the Navy will provide advanced data analytics while fostering an engaged and innovative workforce. In alignment with this statement, ISEA Of The Future - Corona will host a Technical Exchange Meeting where team members across all departments, divisions, and branches may unite to showcase their innovations. We encourage all NSWC Corona personnel, experts and novices alike, to answer the call for submissions."

<h1 id="Vision-Id" style="text-align:center">Vision</h1>
The purpose of the ISEA Of The Future - Corona Technical Exchange Meeting is to promote cross collaboration between departments, divisions, and branches to truly embody the phrase *"One Team"*. We hope to feature NSWC Corona's technical capabilities and break down division-level silos by shining a light on what our exemplary scientists and engineers research and develop daily

It may be argued that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) is divided into two high-level components:
1. Training data that is collected, stored, managed, cleaned, and propogated
2. Statistical model(s) that are fitted from the training data for which we iteratively experiment and optimize performance metrics

Recently, AI/ML pioneers, including e.g. Andrew Ng, argue that changing a businesses' AI culture to data-centric AI is the most important cultural shift a business may take to maximize the benefits from AI systems. If data is meticulously handled to maximize data quality, AI systems may train effectively on smaller datasets leading to less laborious and more efficient operations. As Andrew Ng explains, "it’s often been the cleverness of an individual's skill, or luck with an individual engineer, that determines whether ad hoc data curation gets done well. Making this more systematic through principles and [the use of tools] will help a lot of teams build more AI systems.” Despite this, model-centric AI seems to ring true in the research communities, where frequently the biggest and baddest model architectures are published (particular Transformers). Model-centric AI is no joke, and has been the dominant viewpoint of the AI community since arguably the mid 2000s. ***The question is, which side of the AI community do you stand on?***

            <h2>Model-Centric AI </h2>
            <p>Model-Centric AI's central objective is working on code/algorithms, where rather than handling data with care the model architecture is optimized to deal with the noise in data. Data is static after standard preprocessing (entering into databases), but the model is iteratively improved. </p>

            <h2>Data-Centric AI</h2>
            <p>Data-Centric AI's central objective is data, where rather than gathering more data there is an investment on data quality tools to clean, annotate, and propogate data. Data consistency is the critical factor for success, where code/algorithms are fixed but data quality is iteratively improved. </p>
